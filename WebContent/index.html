				Auto-Auth-Server is an external authentication server &amp; RESTful API capable of authenticating through web portals for arbitrary websites. It uses machine learning techniques to determine website login success or failure, and it is currently hosted on Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk cloud platform. 
				<br/><br/>Auto-Auth-Server is a Master's project by Jay Waldron advised by Professor Ron Cytron at Washington University in St. Louis defended Spring 2014.

			<h2>Why?</h2>
			<p>
				There are many cases where we may want to validate the identity of a user or their account membership for a given website. Tying accounts to domain-specific email addresses is the most common way of handling this but carries its own set of issues, such as the need to manage several additional accounts for users who are otherwise the same individuals. Additionally, while some websites open their authentication portals for public use, the large majority of them do not. One of the primary goals of this project is to create API-like authentication access to sites that do not open their portals by automating browser-side login.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, while a lot of research has been compiled on classifying types of webpages (blog, news, media, etc.), not much has been studied when it comes to examining classifying positive / negative pages in areas such as login responses. Exploring automated authentication in uncertain conditions and for arbitrary websites (at which the administrator does not even require membership to utilize) was another goal for this project.

			<h2>The API</h2>
			<p>Auto-Auth-Server provides a very simple API for general use. You can interact with this demo server using the methods below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p class="api_topic">Get currently active portals: /api/portals</p>
			<hr/>
			<p class="api_header">description:</p><p class="api_details">
				Returns a list of the admin-defined portal codes representing the currently active portals Auto-Auth-Server is running. This list is formatted as a JSON array wrapped in a JSON object under the "portals" key. The array value may be null if no portals are currently active. A portal will not be active (will be omitted from the list) if the server is currently starting up or if a portal is first initializing.

			<h2>How Does This Work?</h2>
			<p>
				Every day there are countless scenarios, both in real life and across the web, where we are required to authenticate and prove our identity. In most all of these cases, authentication occurs by example: you provide an example of your identity by allowing a third-party agent to observe you authenticating. Sometimes this observation is innate in the authentication mechanism, such as an ATM program checking the PIN number you've input before allowing you access to funds. Other times it's more straightforward: a police officer watching you unlock a home's front door may assume within reason that you ought to have access to it. Using similar logic, Auto-Auth-Server watches your credentials return a page after a login attempt and decides whether or not you have authenticated correctly.

			</p>
			<p class="api_header">Structure</p>
			<p>
				Auto-Auth-Server is meant to be easily configurable by administrators to fit their authentication needs.  Upon launching the server, a configuration file with the admin-specified portals is loaded. Login is then attempted at each of the defined sites with purposefully bad credentials in order to obtain a baseline failure. Once setup is finished for a portal, it becomes present in the active portals list and available for use.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a client-side request comes in, the server first checks the requested portal and provided credentials against previous records in the Attempted Login Manager. If a previous record of attempted login exists, the saved login success / failure indication for that record is returned to the user and its access time updated. This information is deleted from the server 5 minutes from its last client access.

				general server structure
			</p>
			<p>
				If no record exists, the server attempts login at the requested portal using the provided credentials. The page loaded after a login attempt is then analyzed by a Random Forest generated model, trained with data from several sites I collected manually. Finally, the result (success / failure) of the login attempt is cached in the Attempted Login Manager for later use and returned to the user. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The use of the default general Random Forest model allows for some pretty neat things to happen. Primarily, it allows an admin to open authentication at a portal where she might not have an account or even know herself what successful authentication looks like! Unfortunately, this model is general, and thus more prone to mistakes than one specialized for one site where the admin knows almost every kind of possible login response. To allow additional flexibility, the admin may define a portal as using a specialized model with some additional setup. For this demo, login at WUSTL uses the general model while Twitter authentication makes use of the specialized model.
			</p>
			<p></p>
			<a id="performance"><p class="api_header">Performance</p></a>
			<p>
				While training the model, accuracy of detecting success / failure login response pages was consistently above 97%. More information on this initial testing and techniques used can be found in the attached slide deck. Live production tests on sites never initially seen by the model are shown below:

			<p class="image_wrapper">
				<img src="assets/test_data.jpg" alt="production test results" /><br/>
				production testing results
			</p>
			<p>
				Login at each site was tested using valid credentials, invalid credentials, and valid credentials after an account was locked. All tests passed successfully except for Twitter's lockout test, which generated a false positive. Using a specialized model for Twitter solved this problem and allowed each test to be passed successfully.

				This description is meant to serve as a broad overview on what's going on behind the scenes. More in-depth information can be found in my <a href="assets/slides.pdf">defense presentation slides</a> or in the FAQs below.

			<h2>FAQs</h2>
			<p class="italic">Do you store my password?</p>
			<p>
				Auto-Auth-Server wants to be as friendly as possible to portal sites with which it interacts. To limit the number of successive login attempts on external sites, the server caches username and password information in memory for 5 minutes since last use. Cached passwords are encrypted with one-way salted hashing, are never saved in persistent storage or human-viewed, and are purged from the server after the 5 minute caching limit.
			</p>
			<br/><p class="italic">Why should I trust you with my credentials?</p>
			<p>
				Trust is an interesting problem on the web. Lots of organizations, people, and bots collaborate to accomplish goals, sometimes ones that deal with sensitive information, and there are often multiple opportunities for information to be compromised within a web of trust. Ultimately, what ensures that any other third-party service (e.g. a third-party Twitter or Facebook app) won't steal your login info? While you don't have to, I do hope you will trust this service, and I have open-sourced the code for this project to help show that nothing nefarious is going on. Check out the section above labeled <a href="#code">Administer Your Own</a> to check out the code.
			</p>
			<br/><p class="italic">I logged in with the correct info, but Auto-Auth-Server says its wrong!</p>
			<p>
				Because each site on the web is radically different, Auto-Auth-Server uses machine learning techniques to classify a login page's response using a model of what typical positive / negative login attempts look like. While it usually has a pretty <a href="#performance">high success rate</a>, the model can certainly get things wrong, especially if a page generated after an otherwise successful login looks very different from what its seen before. To help combat this, Auto-Auth-Server is capable of using a highly specialized model for individual portals. However, this must be configured by the administrator. For this demo, authentication at Twitter uses such a model.
			</p>
			<br/><p class="italic">The API seems slow...</p>
			<p>
				There are currently a handful of reasons things could be a bit slow. One reason is that Auto-Auth-Server authenticates at arbitrary web portals, so its speed depends in part on the speed of the portal with which it's interacting. However, a more likely explanation is that this demo is running on a free-tier AWS EC2 instance, complete with the blazing speed that accompanies a 1-core vCPU and around 512 MB memory.
			</p>
			<br/><p class="italic">I could abuse this.</p>
			<p>
				Please don't. I would like to allow a live demo of this project to remain online for as long as possible, and there are a few safeguards in place to help prevent abuse for this demo. While I hope you'll only use this project for good, not evil, I would greatly appreciate you respecting this demo space and instead downloading the code yourself for any more questionable purposes. This project is meant to offer a benevolent service and explore the world of uncertain authentication, and I certainly don't condone the use of this project for nefarious purposes or assume responsibility for the actions of those using this code for purposes other than the one intended.
